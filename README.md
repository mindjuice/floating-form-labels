# Floating Form Labels ([Demo](http://codepen.io/jChris85/pen/jrZypv))
Floating Form Labels takes [the concept from Matt D. Smit](https://dribbble.com/shots/1254439--GIF-Mobile-Form-Interaction) and wraps it into an easy to use jQuery plugin written by [jChris85](https://github.com/jChris85) and me. Take a look at [the blog post from Brad Frost](http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/float-label-pattern/) to understand why this is essential when dealing with inline form labels.

Floating Form Labels ...
* is [UMD](https://github.com/umdjs/umd) compatible (can be loaded with any module loader)
* supports the placeholder attribute
* is markup agnostic (works with nearly every markup)
* works with inputs _and_ textareas

## Installation
We recommend using a package manager to install Floating Form Labels as a dependency of your project. Please read the docs of the respective package manager if you don't know how to use it.
* [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/floating-form-labels): `npm install floating-form-labels`
* Bower: `bower install floating-form-labels`

You can add the `--save` parameter if you want to add the plugin into your `package.json` or `bower.json`.

Alternatively, you can also download the plugin directly from GitHub, unzip the folder and copy the file `floating-form-labels/dist/floatingFormLabels.min.js` into your project.

## Usage
### HTML
First you have to group your labels and inputs into a container. These containers are the starting point for the JavaScript. We recommend giving them a unique class name. By default, we look for a class named `ffl-wrapper`, but you can change that if you want to.

It's a good idea to add a unique class to your labels as well. This helps avoid bugs when additional error labels are added by validation code or other code. By default we look for a label named `ffl-label`.

```html
<div class="ffl-wrapper">
    <label class="ffl-label" for="input-1">Label for field 1</label>
    <input id="input-1" type="text">
</div>
<div class="ffl-wrapper">
    <label class="ffl-label" for="input-2">Label for field 2</label>
    <input id="input-2" type="text">
</div>
```

### JavaScript
Next you have to load the file `floating-form-labels/dist/floatingFormLabels.min.js` into your project and make sure that [jQuery](http://jquery.com/) is ready to use. You can do this by adding another script tag to your DOM or by using a module loader. Then you have to call the plugin with a selector that matches your wrapping containers.

```javascript
$('.ffl-wrapper').floatingFormLabels();
```

#### Options
| Option | Value | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| label | _String_ | '.ffl-label' | The selector string to find the label that will be floated inside your wrapping container. |
| formElements | _String_ | 'input, textarea' | The form elements that Floating Form Labels will watch. |
| floatedClass | _String_ | 'ffl-floated' | The class that is added to the DOM when a label becomes floated. |

#### Events
The following events are fired on your wrapping container:

| Event | Returns | Description |
|---|---|---|
| init.ffl | _Instance of plugin_ | Fires when Floating Form Labels is ready. |
| toggle.ffl | _Instance of plugin_ | Fires on every interaction with the input. |

#### Examples
If you don't have the control of your markup and want to add this plugin to some custom html:
```javascript
$('.your-custom-wrapper').floatingFormLabels({
    label: 'label',
    floatedClass: 'postponed'
});
```

If you want to check if a label is floated programmatically you use can use events for this:
```javascript
$('label#label-for-input-1').on('toggle.ffl', function (event, ffl) {
    // log out the current state of the label
    console.log(ffl.floated);
});
```

### Sass
By default, Floating Form Labels just triggers some classes in the DOM. To see the desired effect, you have to insert some CSS. You can write that for yourself or you can include our handy [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) mixin that will do most of the job for you. Import the file `floating-form-labels/scss/floating-form-labels.scss` into your project and then include our mixin inside the selector of the wrapping container.
```scss
.ffl-wrapper {
    @include floating-form-labels($position-top, $reserved-space);
}
```
As you can see, there are **two parameters our mixin expects**. The first one, (`$position-top`), is used to move the label from its regular position above the input element. The second one, (`$reserved-space`), is used to create a padding-top inside the wrapper to reserve the space for the label to get floated.

> Why didn't you choose a better way to center the label above the input?

With a _normal_ CSS centering solution you could get in trouble when there more markup is added to your wrapper container (e.g., by validation code). Or in the case of textareas, you don't want to have a _true_ centering. This is why you have to move the labels down using a static parameter. The `$reserved-space` is necessary so the form doesn't jump when a label becomes floated. We didn't want to negatively position the labels, because this could cause some trouble with earlier form elements.

#### Settings
| Setting | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| $ffl-label | ".ffl-label" | The selector string to find the label that will be floated inside your wrapping container. |
| $ffl-floatedClass | ".ffl-floated | The class that is added by the JavaScript. |
| $ffl-transition-duration | 200ms |  |
| $ffl-transition-easing | ease |  |

#### Example
You can change the markup to your own needs or fasten up the transition by just setting two variables.
```scss
$ffl-label: ".my-own-label-class";
$ffl-transition-duration: 100ms;

.your-custom-wrapper {
    @include floating-form-labels(0.7rem, 0.5rem);
}
```

## FAQ
> I've got some ajax content in my form. Is there an update method to init the plugin for this new fields?

You can simply recall the plugin after the ajax is done. The plugin won't get double initialized on the fields that are already present.

> I have nested my input element inside the label to save the for attribute. Is this DOM structure also supported or has the input and the label to be on the same level?

Yes this structure is also supported because Floating Form Labels is markup agnostic. You only have to wrap the text of the label inside an element (e.g., a `<span>`) that can be positioned above the input. For example your markup could look like this:

```html
<label class="ffl-wrapper">
    <span class="ffl-label">Label</span>
    <input type="text">
</label>
```
